# Current Operating Envelope

Status: Current operational routing snapshot; non-authorizing
Reconciled: 2026-08-23

## Purpose

Read this document before any provider, credential, network, scheduler,
canonical-store, migration, promotion, retirement, deployment, public-
exposure, or destructive operation.

This envelope consolidates existing user decisions and evidence. It grants no
new execution authority. Code, credentials, registry declarations, unit files,
database files, and historical instructions establish only that artifacts
exist. If an action is not explicitly permitted by the current user request,
stop. A separate focused contract is required only when the
[fast-path](FAST_PATH_DEVELOPMENT.md) heavy-workflow criteria require one;
otherwise the current request plus a stated bounded operational scope is
sufficient authority.

Detailed receipts, hashes, counts, request rules, and historical limitations
remain in the linked contracts and evidence. This file records only the
current control boundary.

## Authority and working-state disclosure

The authority order is the one in the
[rebuild index](README.md): explicit user decisions, accepted ADRs, focused
contracts, the roadmap, and then recovery history.

The current accepted registry is revision `2.31.0`, schema `1.8.0`, with
source SHA-256 `d28298c36ce6b418ec516845ac3f58c8b9e4c0706afdacbb5f752ed7d5431bd0`.
The former working `2.22.0`/`validated` candidate is rejected under
[ADR 0011](../adr/0011-retire-proposed-bls-cpi-release-archive.md). It never
established provider, canonical-store, consumer, scheduler, or live-population
authority. Because it never entered the active configuration lineage, it
remains absent from the later additive Treasury `2.23.0`, NY Fed headline
rate `2.24.0`, NY Fed repo-facility `2.25.0`, NY Fed SOMA-summary `2.26.0`,
official macro-conditions `2.27.0`, NY Fed CMDI `2.28.0`, Treasury/EIA/NBER
macro extension `2.29.0`, BLS price/wage/productivity `2.30.0`, and
GDI-vintage `2.31.0` revisions. Revision `2.31.0` adds only additive macro
migration 0017; it adds no scheduler, public surface, dataset ownership,
collector, or credential mechanism. Revision `2.29.0` and the fixed
electricity-retail refresh reuse the existing EIA credential resolver, while
`2.30.0` remains credential-free.

An explicitly authorized 2026-08-21 immutable read-only proof, performed while
registry `2.21.0` was current, confirmed that the canonical macro store
identifies itself as `macro`, ends at the exact accepted ordinal-16 FMP
wholesale migration,
and contains no `0017` ledger collision or BLS original-release archive
relation. Main/WAL/SHM/journal physical stamps were unchanged and all
sidecars were absent. This one-time proof grants no continuing canonical-read
authority. Ignored scratch captures and publisher artifacts remain evidence
that the rejected workflow was exercised; they are not accepted activation or
completion authority.

The current canonical project-relative store declarations are:

| Store | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Market | `data/market.sqlite` |
| Macro | `data/macro.sqlite` |
| Company | `data/company.sqlite` |
| News | `data/news.sqlite` |

A registry path declaration never authorizes opening, creating, migrating, or
writing the corresponding database.

## Bounded manual operational fast path

A current explicit user request may authorize a finite manual provider
workload, use of an existing credential resolver, and writes to an existing
canonical store without creating a new project stage or evidence program.
Before execution, the agent states the resolved provider/dataset, exact store,
date or universe scope, request cap, and retry policy. That single
authorization covers all enumerated units within the stated cap; a separate
approval is not required for each window or symbol.

This lane is available only when the established provider integration,
credential name/resolver, schema, store role/path, locks, and replay-safe
publisher are reused. Responses are bounded and validated before locking;
network work is complete before a write transaction begins; writes are atomic
and use existing relations; and focused preflight plus post-write counts and
integrity checks can establish the result. A private collector binding to
existing datasets is allowed when it adds no migration, dataset ownership,
job, timer, export, public tool, or caller-selected path.

This is task-scoped authority, not a standing provider or store permission. It
does not cover a new provider or credential mechanism, migration, destructive
rewrite, store copy/replacement/promotion/retirement, scheduler, recurring
automation, deployment, public exposure, or an unbounded/materially costly
workload. Those actions retain their applicable heavier gates. It also does
not silently reopen a completed no-repeat population; the current user request
must identify that population if repetition is intended.

## Retired BLS CPI original-release archive candidate

ADR 0011 retires only the proposed `2.22.0` BLS CPI original-release archive:
`macro:0017_bls_cpi_release_archive`, its archive datasets, collector,
handler, and relations. CPI surprises remain FMP-only; archive availability
may not validate, fill, replace, or otherwise affect an output. This does not
retire the completed `2.16.0` BLS annual-revision snapshots, the completed
14-file historical backfill, or the fixed current BLS refresh. No provider,
scheduler, store, or historical-population action follows from the retirement.

## Canonical market boundary

- Stage 12C is complete and is the sole reviewed write to
  `data/market.sqlite`. Its provider work must not be repeated or broadened.
  See the [contract](STAGE12C_MARKET_GAP_V1.md) and
  [evidence](STAGE12C_EVIDENCE.md).
- Stage 12D is complete as a no-transfer, read-only adoption/freeze proof. It
  authorizes no provider, credential, write, copy, backup, promotion, public
  consumer, or scheduler action. See the
  [contract](STAGE12D_PROJECT_LOCAL_OPERATIONALIZATION.md) and
  [evidence](STAGE12D_EVIDENCE.md).
- Stage 12E remains closed. The presence of market-close service/timer files
  does not authorize linking, starting, enabling, testing, or scheduling them.
- No other default-path market operation is authorized.

## Active recurring exceptions

Exactly four recurring scheduler exceptions are recorded as installed and
active. Their normal clock-driven execution is the boundary; agents must not
manually trigger, change, retry, broaden, reinstall, disable, or repurpose
them.

| Timer | Fixed scope |
| --- | --- |
| `quant-data-macro-vintages.timer` | 09:05 America/New_York on weekdays. One current BEA GDP/GDI workbook request and one current BLS GDP/CPI request; no retry, migration, credential, or historical-archive fetch. |
| `quant-data-employment-vintages.timer` | First Friday of each month at 10:05 America/New_York. One credential-free BLS request for the fixed payroll and unemployment series; no retry, migration, or Philadelphia Fed historical-workbook fetch. |
| `quant-data-fmp-macro-calendar.timer` | 08:15 and 08:45 America/New_York on weekdays. One bounded current-window FMP calendar request with no retry. The response is retained as wholesale raw evidence before independent GDP/CPI and employment normalization. |
| `quant-data-macro-current-refresh.timer` | 18:30 America/New_York on weekdays. Thirteen established macro collector operations run sequentially with a total provider-request cap of 21, no retry, a fixed `data/macro.sqlite` target, and semantic no-write behavior when content is unchanged. It covers Treasury curve; NY Fed overnight rates including SOFR distribution, volume, index, and compounded averages; repo facilities and SOMA; H.4.1; NFCI/ANFCI including risk, credit, and leverage; BIS credit conditions; CMDI; Treasury cash; EIA gas storage and monthly electricity retail; NBER recession chronology; and BLS PPI, earnings, and productivity. |

These exceptions do not enable any recovered Stage 7 job, market-close timer,
new provider, new series, different cadence, catch-up run, or historical
backfill. The aggregate current refresh leaves the underlying registry
collectors manual-only and is a separate fixed host-level exception. See
[scheduling and locking](SCHEDULING_AND_LOCKING.md) and the read-only
[unit inspection guide](../../deploy/systemd/README.md).

## Completed work that must not be repeated

The following are completed, retained operations, not standing permissions:

- the bounded Stage 9 FMP SPY slice
  ([evidence](STAGE9_EVIDENCE.md));
- the Stage 10 base population and historical extension
  ([evidence](STAGE10_EVIDENCE.md));
- the Stage 11 BEA/EIA macro population
  ([evidence](STAGE11_EVIDENCE.md));
- the Stage 12C two-session market population
  ([evidence](STAGE12C_EVIDENCE.md));
- the one-time GDP/CPI historical archive and initial official-vintage
  population;
- the one-time Philadelphia Fed employment historical-workbook population;
- the one-time macro-history extension and local Stage 11 weekly adoption;
- the one-time FMP GDP/CPI release-calendar history;
- the one-time FMP wholesale calendar history and its local replay;
- the one-time FMP Treasury curve population;
- the one-request New York Fed headline-rate population for the inclusive
  requested window `2016-03-01` through `2026-08-21`, published to
  `data/macro.sqlite` on 2026-08-21. It retained 11,549 current observations:
  2,632 EFFR, 2,632 OBFR, and 2,095 each for TGCR, BGCR, and SOFR. The provider
  returned observations through `2026-08-20`; integrity and foreign-key checks
  passed, and the fixed local Inspector read returned EFFR `3.63` for that
  date. On 2026-08-23, two separately authorized no-retry requests over the
  same fixed window added four SOFR percentiles and SOFR volume with 2,095
  observations each from `2018-04-02` through `2026-08-20`, plus the SOFR
  index and 30/90/180-day compounded averages with 1,618 observations each
  from `2020-03-02` through `2026-08-21`;
- the one-request New York Fed repo-facility population for the inclusive
  requested window `2016-03-01` through `2026-08-21`, published to
  `data/macro.sqlite` on 2026-08-22. It retained 3,882 current observations:
  2,618 ON RRP rows from `2016-03-01` through `2026-08-21`, and 1,264 SRF
  rows from the facility start `2021-07-29` through `2026-08-21`. The latest
  accepted amounts were USD 200,000,000 for ON RRP and USD 0 for SRF. Integrity
  and foreign-key checks passed, and the fixed local Inspector returned both
  series under the `Repo facilities` view at registry `2.26.0`; and
- the one-request New York Fed aggregate SOMA-summary population for the
  inclusive requested window `2003-07-09` through `2026-08-21`, published
  to `data/macro.sqlite` on 2026-08-22. The provider returned 1,207 weekly
  summaries through `2026-08-19`; all nine declared aggregate components per
  week were retained as 10,863 component rows in the existing SOMA relations,
  with source-empty values represented explicitly and amounts stored in
  thousands of USD. Integrity and foreign-key checks passed, and the fixed
  local Inspector returned 1,207 latest total-holdings rows under the
  `SOMA summary` view at registry `2.26.0`;
- the one-request Federal Reserve H.4.1 population for the requested window
  `2002-12-18` through `2026-08-22`, published to `data/macro.sqlite` on
  2026-08-22 from one FRED ZIP carrying the underlying Board series. It
  retained 1,236 weekly observations each for total assets, reserve balances,
  and the Treasury General Account through `2026-08-19` (3,708 total);
- the one-request Chicago Fed population for the requested window
  `1971-01-08` through `2026-08-22`, published on 2026-08-22. It retained
  2,902 weekly observations each for NFCI and ANFCI through `2026-08-14`
  (5,804 total). One later authorized same-response refresh on 2026-08-23
  added 2,902 observations each for the NFCI risk, credit, and leverage
  components over the same coverage, bringing the five-series checkpoint to
  14,510 observations; and
- the two-request BIS U.S. private non-financial credit population for the
  requested window `1961-Q1` through `2026-Q2`, published on 2026-08-22.
  Credit-to-GDP and its gap each retained 260 quarters from `1961-Q1` through
  `2025-Q4`; debt-service ratio retained 108 quarters from `1999-Q1`
  through `2025-Q4` (628 total). Immutable read-only integrity checks passed
  after all three `2.27.0` populations, and the fixed Inspector views are
  `Fed H.4.1 liquidity`, `Financial conditions`, and `BIS credit conditions`.
- the one-request NY Fed CMDI population for the requested window
  `2005-01-07` through `2026-08-22`, published on 2026-08-22 from the
  fixed official workbook. It retained 1,125 weekly observations each for
  the overall market, investment-grade, and high-yield indexes through
  `2026-07-24` (3,375 total). Immutable read-only integrity and foreign-key
  checks passed, and the restarted local Inspector returns all 1,125
  overall-market rows under `Corporate bond distress` at registry `2.28.0`;
- the one-request Treasury Fiscal Data TGA population for the requested window
  `2005-10-01` through `2026-08-22`, published on 2026-08-22. The provider
  returned and the canonical store retained 1,089 daily observations from
  `2022-04-18` through `2026-08-20`;
- the one-request EIA Lower-48 working natural-gas-storage population,
  published on 2026-08-22 through the existing EIA credential resolver. It
  retained 868 weekly observations from `2010-01-01` through `2026-08-14`;
  and
- the one-request NBER business-cycle chronology population, published on
  2026-08-22 from the fixed official JSON. It retained 2,061 derived monthly
  recession-indicator observations from `1854-12` through `2026-08`.
  Immutable read-only integrity and foreign-key checks passed after all three
  `2.29.0` populations, and the fixed Inspector views return 1,089 Treasury,
  868 natural-gas, and 2,061 recession rows; and
- the credential-free BLS price/wage/productivity population. Its initial
  fixed 2017 through 2026 API request, published on 2026-08-22, retained 115
  monthly PPI, 115 monthly average-hourly-earnings, and 38 quarterly
  labor-productivity observations. Five later authorized, non-overlapping
  productivity-only requests for 1947-1956 through 1987-1996 added 199 rows.
  An earlier mixed 1997-2006 request was rejected before publication. On
  2026-08-23 a bounded three-attempt, no-retry extension first rejected a
  PPI-only 2007-2016 request before publication, then published 182 PPI and
  earnings versions from one 2009-2016 request and 34 earnings versions from
  one 2006-2008 request. The immutable checkpoint is now 201 PPI observations
  from source-native `2009-11` through `2026-07`, 245 earnings observations
  from source-native `2006-03` through `2026-07`, and 237 productivity
  observations from `1947-Q2` through `2026-Q2` (683 total). Integrity,
  foreign-key, sidecar, and fixed Inspector checks passed. The source provides no PPI observation before 2009-11 and no earnings
  observation before 2006-03. The successful
  initial and historical windows must not be repeated; any different scope
  requires new finite authorization; and
- the one-request current BEA GDP/GDI workbook refresh published on
  2026-08-23. It added 97 current real and 97 current nominal GDI quarters
  from `2002Q1` through `2026Q1`, with 916 real and 933 nominal retained
  vintage versions. The paired BLS response was replayed without adding an
  observation version. Integrity and foreign-key checks passed, and the fixed
  Inspector returns both GDI series at registry `2.31.0`.

The weekday aggregate current-refresh exception above may revalidate its fixed
current or source-native full-response scopes after these initial populations.
That narrow recurring no-retry path does not authorize a manual repeat,
historical extension, catch-up run, different range, provider change, or
additional series.

The rebuild [index](README.md), root [project record](../../README.md), and
stage evidence own the exact scope, receipt, waiver, hash, count, and historical
projection details. None of the completed work authorizes a repeat, new target,
new date range, provider change, retry, promotion, retirement, public exposure,
or scheduler beyond the four fixed exceptions above.

## Closed operations

Outside a current bounded operational authorization or an applicable accepted
heavier gate:

- do not make a live provider request outside the four clock-driven
  exceptions above;
- do not read an existing credential or introduce a credential mechanism for
  an unapproved operation;
- do not install, start, enable, disable, update, or remove a scheduler;
- do not open or write an existing canonical store, or create, migrate, copy,
  move, back up, replace, promote, retire, or destructively inspect one;
- do not expose a public tool, dashboard, export, route, or caller-selected
  database path;
- do not host or deploy Atlas, connect it to operational stores, or run live
  diagnostics;
- do not repeat a completed historical population or locally adopted cohort;
  and
- do not infer authority from a declaration, test, unit file, executable,
  database, environment variable, or historical instruction.

Read-only canonical checks are allowed when the bounded operational scope or
applicable accepted procedure makes them in scope. They must use the
established immutable/fingerprint-preserving procedure; an ordinary SQLite
open can create or update sidecars and is not presumed mutation-free.
