# Quant Data Infrastructure

This repository is a clean rebuild of a personal quant-data platform. The
current executable scope is the bounded offline Stage 3 market and macro
restoration, which is fixture-validated and independently verified. It extends the independently
verified Stage 2 foundation of four explicitly routed SQLite stores, reviewed
synthetic fixtures, a shared artifact/snapshot/quality/run-audit control plane,
point-in-time reads, two read-only tools, read-only health, and WAL-safe online
backup and restore. It has no live providers or network collection, scheduler
jobs or installation, exports, Atlas, promotion, credentials, destructive
storage operations, or default database fallback.

The target design and sequencing are documented in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md),
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), and the [rebuild documentation index](docs/rebuild/README.md).
The new migration resources are deliberate reconstructions; they do not claim
byte-exact recovery of the lost application.

The preserved Stage 1 slice and its historical hashes are recorded in the
[Stage 1 acceptance evidence](docs/rebuild/STAGE1_EVIDENCE.md). The current
four-store foundation and its approved deterministic receipts are recorded in
the [Stage 2 acceptance evidence](docs/rebuild/STAGE2_EVIDENCE.md). The bounded
Stage 3 primary-gate receipts are recorded in the
[Stage 3 acceptance evidence](docs/rebuild/STAGE3_EVIDENCE.md).

## Validate Stage 1

Run the dependency-free offline suite from the WSL project root:

```bash
cd /home/volatility/Python_Projects/Quant_Data_Infra
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -v
```

Run the deterministic two-rebuild harness with two explicit clean roots:

```bash
cd /home/volatility/Python_Projects/Quant_Data_Infra
stage1_root="$(mktemp -d)"
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m quant_data \
  --stage stage1 \
  --project-root "$PWD" \
  --store-root "$stage1_root/first" \
  --second-store-root "$stage1_root/second"
```

The command refuses a nonempty store root. It verifies migration and fixture
digests, exact no-write replays, corrections and revisions, the golden query
matrix, tool/HTTP equivalence, read-only store fingerprints, integrity, and
equal path-free logical manifests across both rebuilds. Its output is strict
JSON evidence.

## Validate Stage 2

Run the deterministic Stage 2 two-rebuild gate with two explicit empty work
roots:

```bash
cd /home/volatility/Python_Projects/Quant_Data_Infra
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m quant_data \
  --stage stage2 \
  --project-root "$PWD" \
  --store-root <empty-work-root-1> \
  --second-store-root <empty-work-root-2>
```

The Stage 2 gate rebuilds the Stage 1 fixture state under each work root, adds
the four-store control plane, verifies source reads are non-mutating, and
requires deterministic source, backup, and restored evidence. It refuses a
nonempty work root and emits strict JSON. The final full-suite command is the
same dependency-free command above; its current implementation result and
separate independent-verifier status are recorded in the
[Stage 2 acceptance evidence](docs/rebuild/STAGE2_EVIDENCE.md).

## Validate Stage 3

Run the deterministic Stage 3 two-rebuild gate with two explicit empty work
roots under `/tmp`:

```bash
cd /home/volatility/Python_Projects/Quant_Data_Infra
first_root="$(mktemp -d /tmp/quant-data-stage3-first.XXXXXX)"
second_root="$(mktemp -d /tmp/quant-data-stage3-second.XXXXXX)"
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 TMPDIR=/tmp python3 -m quant_data \
  --stage stage3 \
  --project-root /home/volatility/Python_Projects/Quant_Data_Infra \
  --store-root "$first_root" \
  --second-store-root "$second_root"
```

The gate upgrades a verified Stage 2 cohort under each work root, imports only
the 25 reviewed Stage 3 synthetic fixtures, and compares strict path-free
evidence from both roots. It verifies replay and rejected-capture no-write
behavior, point-in-time results, source-read/backup/restore non-mutation, and
equal restored health. It refuses a nonempty work root and emits strict JSON.
The primary fixture gate and independent SolUltra verification have passed.
Stage 4 remains unimplemented and requires separate explicit authorization.

## Current public boundary

Only `macro.get_series` and `timeseries.describe` are validated public tools.
All 57 compatibility names remain reserved; no other public tool is validated
at this stage. Application hosts must construct `StoreMap.four_explicit(...)`
and supply all four paths. Public callers cannot select a database path, submit
SQL, or initialize a store. Stage 3 adds no public tools, jobs, or exports;
company, news, and options restoration remain closed until Stage 4 is
explicitly authorized.
